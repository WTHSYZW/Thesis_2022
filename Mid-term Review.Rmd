# Abstract

Understanding and reflecting urban dwellers' happiness, and perception of urban space and life in urban planning has long been a challenge in China. The Chinese government has progressively brought attention to public participation and views, which had previously been ignored. However, government approaches for fostering public engagement remain scarce, while enthusiasm among individuals to express feelings and comments on government planning is lacking. In this context, my research project proposes measuring individual citizens' emotions and characteristics of the built environment,the proximity to various urban amenities, to explore the relationships between citizens' sentiments, urban space, and urban activities. This approach can be applied to gather public feelings in the urban planning process through platforms, as a way to quantify the quality of urban life. By establishing a quantitative urban model, the happiness of urban residents(the sentiment of social media post) can become an indicator and standard as a way of bottom-up public participation, guiding planners' decisions to design a healthy, sustainable and people-centered city.

# Introduction
In China, the early stage of urbanization was subject to the national ambition and development, whose aim at boosting the economic production and consumption. As such, hundreds and thousands of cities and towns were built to serve for this purpose that plays an important role in improving the national economy based on the scarification of natural resource and incline of factory production. However, since the decreasing demand for industrial production and the arise of urban awareness of residents happiness, Chinese government increasingly focus on citizen wellbeing, urban governance and the urban environment. 

The new urban policies in China shifted the emphasis of urbanization away from economic development and toward human-centric development, improving residents' wellbeing and building new ecological smart cities. However, the evaluation of residents' wellbeing and urban planning process remains top-down and entirely conducted by governments and experts. The qualitative surveys and reports could only cover a small proportion of population, and it becomes even harder and time-consuming as the population in cities and towns reached 848 millions. 

With the introduction of social media data and machine learning technologies, new methods for studying urban spatial patterns and residents' life have emerged. In 2017, there were more than 753 million people have access to mobile internet, while 68% of them frequently use social media platform. The AI-based technology such as sentiment analysis could be used to extract individual feelings from text-based information, as a form of public perception of urban space, contributing to bottom-up engagement and people-oriented urban planning.
